# homework-04-code-quiz

A timed quiz that presents the user with multiple choice questions about coding.(Currently has only two questions, but more can be added to the questions array without disrupting the functionality of the quiz).

The timer starts at one minute and is reduced by 10 seconds each time a wrong answer is clicked.

If the timer reaches zero, the quiz is over.

If all questions are answered correctly, the timer stops. The remaining time is the user's score. Thus, the faster the quiz is completed, the higher the score.

When the quiz is complete the user is able to submit their innitials and score, which are saved in local storage.

When the saved scores are viewed, they are displayed from most to least recent.
